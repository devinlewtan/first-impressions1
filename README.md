# First Impressions / Judge me

## Overview

We all know the saying "don't judge a book by it's cover." First impressions are typically wrong and based on stereotypical profiling. But what if... someone explicitly requested you to judge them by an image?

First Impressions is a web-based game that presents users with a photo of a stranger and a quiz about them with general attributes like name, city, job title, and more contentious attributes like race, sexual orientation, dietary restrictions, etc. How much can we truly uncover from an image of a person? How much falls through the cracks? First Impressions is fun for both those guessing about others as well as for those who upload a photo - what do people judge about your cover?

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Profiles, and Questions (user-uploaded)

* users can have one profile (via references)
* each profile can have multiple questions (via references)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  email: "devinlewtan@gmail.com",
  password: "$ecret$auce",
}
```

An Example Profile:

```javascript
{
  user_id: 'devinlewtan@gmail.com', // a reference to a User object
  image: {
    contentType: 'image/png',
    data: Buffer,
  },
  question_ids: [24trgve5g34, 34t5yhedfgw3, 4t3ergw434, 4t4wtwefsd],
}
```
An Example Question:

```javascript
{
	profile_id: "devinlewtan@gmail.com",
	question: "what is my name?",
  answers: [
    {letter: 'a', value: 'Devin', timesVoted: 0},
    {letter: 'b', value: 'Anna', timesVoted: 0},
    {letter: 'c', value: 'Erica', timesVoted: 0},
    {letter: 'd', value: 'Olivia', timesVoted: 0},
  ],
	correctAnswer: 'a',
};
```

## User Stories or Use Cases

###### (non-registered)
1. as a user, I can pick one answer for each profile (quiz/poll style)
2. as a user, I can see the right answers once i've played 

###### (registered)
1. as a user, I can register an account on the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can upload a profile with the site
4. as a user, I can see what others guessed
5. as a user, I can share this with my friends (social media)
6. as a user, I can log out of the site

## Research Topics

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
  * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
  * I'm going to include GoogleOauth as well as Twitter (using passport)
  * I want login to be as frictionless as possible to encourage more users to create profiles 
* (2 points) Implement quiz functionality / html
  * see <code>https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript</code>
  * I've never had to build something that has multiple answers with right/wrong statuses. It should be a good challenge for this assignment!
* (3 points) User uploaded images
  * accept user uploaded images. requires saving images to database in Buffer format at rendering. This has proven to be quite difficult so far... definitely consider it part of my research!
